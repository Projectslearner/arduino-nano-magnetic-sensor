# Magnetic Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Magnetic Sensor project demonstrates how to interface a magnetic sensor with an Arduino Nano to detect magnetic fields. The magnetic sensor, often based on a Hall effect sensor, can detect the presence or absence of a magnetic field. This project provides a basic setup for reading digital values from the magnetic sensor and controlling an LED based on the detected magnetic field.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Magnetic Sensor Module**
3. **LED**
4. **Resistors**
5. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Magnetic Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the digital pin of the magnetic sensor module to a digital pin (e.g., pin 2) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the LED to a suitable output pin (e.g., pin 13) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Ensure proper voltage levels and grounding for stable operation of the module.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the magnetic sensor and LED to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer via USB.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the Serial Monitor.
   - Observe the Serial Monitor to view the state of the magnetic sensor.
   - Verify the behavior of the LED based on the presence or absence of a magnetic field near the sensor.

#### Applications

- **Proximity Sensing:** Utilize the magnetic sensor for proximity detection applications, such as door/window sensors, object detection, and position sensing.
- **Security Systems:** Integrate the sensor into security systems to detect the opening or closing of doors, windows, or cabinets.
- **Automation:** Incorporate the sensor into automated systems for triggering actions based on the presence of magnetic objects, such as activating/deactivating electronic locks or alarms.

#### Notes

- Ensure proper calibration of the magnetic sensor based on the strength and orientation of the magnetic field to be detected.
- Adjust the sensitivity of the sensor and LED response in the code to suit specific application requirements.
- Shield the sensor from external magnetic interference sources to prevent false detections and ensure accurate operation.
