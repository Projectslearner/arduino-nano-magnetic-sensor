# Magnetic Sensor

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a magnetic sensor with an Arduino Nano to detect the presence of a magnetic field. The sensor outputs a digital signal based on whether a magnetic field is detected or not.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Nano**
- **Magnetic Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram

#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Magnetic Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - **Signal Pin:** Connect to digital pin 2 on Arduino Nano.
   - **VCC:** Connect to 5V on Arduino Nano.
   - **GND:** Connect to GND on Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the magnetic sensor module to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the serial monitor output. The sensor value will change (HIGH or LOW) depending on the presence of a magnetic field.

#### Applications

- **Magnetic Field Detection:** Use for applications where detecting the presence or absence of a magnetic field is required.
- **Proximity Sensing:** Implement in projects where proximity to magnetic objects needs to be monitored.
- **Security Systems:** Useful for integrating magnetic field sensing into security alarms or door/window sensors.

#### Notes

- Ensure the sensor module is correctly connected to the Arduino Nano and powered.
- Adjust the sensitivity or detection range if necessary by modifying the sensor module or the code.
- Consider additional features or components based on your specific project needs.
